Purpose
-------
This note captures the current workspace state, how to resume development, quick verification commands, and prioritized next steps for the RecipeStorage work (branch: `RecipeStorage`). Use this to pick up work in a few days without losing context.

Important context
-----------------
- Branch: `RecipeStorage`
- Last focused area: wiring frontend to the new backend API (presigned S3 image upload + API GET proxy) and keeping storage adapter compatible with remote API.
- Note: You made manual edits to `terraform/backend_api.tf` after the last session — double-check that file before running any Terraform `apply`.

Files you should know about (recent/important)
-----------------------------------------------
Frontend
- `src/components/DetailsModal.tsx` — presigned upload flow: POST `/images` to get a presigned PUT URL, upload file directly, and save returned `url` or API GET key path.
- `src/components/RecipeList.tsx` — resolves `image` field to `${REACT_APP_API_BASE}/images/{key}` when the image looks like a key (no HTTP scheme).
- `src/components/CookModal.tsx` — same image GET-proxy logic as `RecipeList`.
- `src/lib/storage.ts` — remote adapter uses `REACT_APP_API_BASE` when set.

Backend & infra
- `terraform/` — contains the Terraform configuration for S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, CloudWatch. You modified `terraform/backend_api.tf` manually; review before applying.
- `terraform/lambda/recipes/app.py` — Python Lambda for recipe CRUD and ratings.
- `terraform/lambda/images/app.py` — Python Lambda that returns presigned PUT URLs (POST /images) and presigned GET or proxied GET support.
- `terraform/lambda/tests/` — pytest + moto unit tests for Lambdas (run locally in a virtualenv).

How to resume (zsh-ready commands)
----------------------------------
1) Checkout branch and sync

```bash
cd /Users/robl/dev/static/mbm-ui
git checkout RecipeStorage
git pull --ff-only
```

2) Install frontend dependencies (npm)

```bash
npm install
```

3) Run frontend unit tests (vitest)

```bash
npm test
```

4) Start the dev server with API integration
- Replace the placeholder with your API Gateway base URL (no trailing slash):

```bash
export REACT_APP_API_BASE="https://YOUR_API_BASE"
npm run dev
```

Open the displayed Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

5) Re-run Python Lambda unit tests (optional)

```bash
cd terraform/lambda
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install boto3 moto pytest
pytest -q
```

If you have a `requirements.txt` in `terraform/lambda`, prefer `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6) Terraform (inspect only unless you intend to change infra)

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
# run terraform apply only if you intend to change infra and you have confirmed the manual edits to backend_api.tf
```

Quick smoke test (manual)
-------------------------
- Start the frontend with `REACT_APP_API_BASE` set (see step 4).
- Create a recipe in the UI, attach an image in DetailsModal, save.
- Confirm the image displays in the list and cook modal.
- Check the S3 bucket (Console or `aws s3 ls`) for the object.
- Inspect CloudWatch logs for the images/recipes Lambdas for any errors.

Troubleshooting tips
--------------------
- If image upload fails, `DetailsModal` currently falls back to the data-URL preview and saves the recipe; check browser console for upload errors.
- If tests fail after edits, run `npm run build` to catch TypeScript issues then `npm test`.
- Before running `terraform apply`, inspect `terraform/backend_api.tf` because you edited it manually — ensure providers, region, and resource names are correct and credentials are configured.

Prioritized next steps (pick one)
---------------------------------
1) Add unit tests for `DetailsModal` to mock POST `/images` and the S3 PUT to verify the upload flow and fallback behavior.
2) Improve UX: show upload progress and explicit error messages in `DetailsModal` if presigned upload fails.
3) Harden presign flow: validate shape of JSON returned from POST `/images`, retry transient errors, and expose errors to the UI.
4) Centralize image URL resolution into a helper in `src/lib` to avoid duplicated logic across components.
5) Add CI step to run frontend tests, Python Lambda tests, and terraform fmt/check.

Notes & assumptions
-------------------
- No live API URL is embedded here. Set `REACT_APP_API_BASE` before running the dev server if you want to integrate with the deployed backend.
- The workspace uses npm for local commands; pnpm is optional but not required.
- Lambda tests rely on `moto` and a Python virtualenv.

If you'd like, I can: add a minimal unit test for `DetailsModal` now, or implement a `HELP.md` with more developer-oriented troubleshooting commands (CloudWatch queries, AWS CLI snippets). Say which and I'll implement it.
